<p>Working in people centered environments brings great joy . Communicating effectively while establishing quick empathetic rapport, gives me great professional pride. Courteous, with a helpful, can do behavior modeling personality and an ability to work independently, serves me as a go to employee. I am committed to the leadership challenge of developing under utilized neighborhood resources, leveraging them with 21st century entrepreneurship (on a digital platform) to make the sum of the community greater than its parts. My warm energetic style make me a trustworthy team player who works well with colleagues and management.</p>

in my quest to understand others. I learned from Steven Covey that I should seek first to understand before I seek to be understood. As a consequence my powers to understand have been broadened and resistance by you has become futile
